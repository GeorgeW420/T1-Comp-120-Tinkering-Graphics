The image that you wish to be reskinned should be saved in the "Entity Reskinning\Images" folder (Note: The program is designed to take a red image and reskin it to yellow, green, and blue.).
In "ReskinTool.py" you will then need to change the variables "originalFilename" and "originalFileExtension" so that they match the file name and file extension of your image respectively. The program can then be run.

The new files will then be saved in the "Entity Reskinning\Images" folder with the original files name plus the colour that it has been reskinned to in brackets, for example "myimage(blue)". By default the generated images will be .png however this can be changed by changing the value of the "generatedImageFileExtension" variable.

Contract #5 - Colour Blindness User Interface Analysis Tool\
Lead Programmer - Charlie
